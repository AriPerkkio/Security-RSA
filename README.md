# Security-RSA
Security Assignment, Implementing 128-bit RSA with prime number and extended Euclidean calculations

In this assignment, you are required to write a program in C++/ JAVA( any programming language) to implement the RSA algorithm.
Requirements:

1) Generate two large random numbers   (128bits)

2) Test if the number generated is prime number 

3) Implement RSA Algorithm to generate public and private key

4) Use keys  generated from RSA to Encrypt and Decrypted files and messages

*Friendly  GUI is required. Using exiting library to implement RSA algorithm will deduct 25%
